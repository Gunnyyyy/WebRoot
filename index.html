        <h1>Gunhee Kim</h1>
        <p>Hello, I’m Gunhee Kim. I’m a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Samsung Electronics and Semiconductor for trial testing team.
            I specialize testing in Google and Samsung devices to meet the standards before they reach to the public market.            
            I find and solve issues that impacts US user’s experience and device performance.
            I have 4 years of experience in collecting and analyzing logs by executing various test cases, such as performance, functional and stability testing for most US network carriers such as ATT, TMO, VZW in both field and labs.
            One of my strength is to adapt quickly to new technologies and deliver reliable results consistently and daily send reports in a timely manner under tight deadlines.
            I’m excited about the potential to make better products from the testing processes and contribute solutions for Samsung. 
            Thank you.</p>
